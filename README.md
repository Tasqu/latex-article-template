# latex-article-template
A simple LaTeX article template.

This template is intended to be used for preparing drafts of manuscripts for journal submissions,
and contains typical common elements found in final journal templates.
Please note that journals don't always allow publishing of preprints using their templates,
so having a different template during manuscript preparation can make publishing preprints easier.

The template is modularized as much as possible, with the `main.tex` tying it all together.
This is done to facilitate swapping the contents onto a new template for submission,
although sometimes journals require all LaTeX source to be in a single file.
