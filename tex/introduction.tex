%% This file contains the introduction sections.
% This is just my preference for the subsections,
% feel free to tweak according to your preference.

% The introduction should consist of the following:
% 1. Create a research space (CARS): What is this research about? Why is it important?
% 2. Identify a research niche: What is known about the subject? What is missing/lacking? How can we address this?
% 3. Contribution: How does this study address the niche? What are the research questions?
% 4. Structure: How is this study structured? How are we going to answer our questions?
% (Kniivilä et al. 2017, p. XXX)
% I personally prefer to include `Structure' immediately after CARS.
