%% This file contains the abstract.
% Just the text, as different journals can have different
% conventions for how their abstract is formatted.

% The abstract is the `pitch' of your research, the summary
% reader's use to decide whether reading the rest is worth
% their time. It should include the following:
% 1. Scientific motivation / background. Why is this work important?
% 2. Define the scope. What are we trying to do? What are the research questions we want to answer?
% 3. Summarize data/methods. How did we address the research questions?
% 4. Main results. What did we achieve?
% 5. Discussion and conclusions. How do our results compare? Are they any good? How can they be applied or refined?
