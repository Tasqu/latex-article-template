%% This file contains the materials and methods sections.
% Verty straightforward. Simply explain all materials and
% methods in as much detail as necessary.

% Ideally, this section fulfills the following criteria:
% 1. It's clear how the presented methods aim to address the research questions.
% 2. The presented methods (and their use) are well justified, and can properly address the research questions.
% 3. The methods are presented in enough detail to allow independently recreating the study.
