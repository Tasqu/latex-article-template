%% What makes a good research paper? (Personal opinions)

% Clarity and conciseness. To me, research papers exist to convey insights as efficiently as possible.
% Text structure helps with this as well, as well-structured text is faster to browse through.
% I also think that a reader should be able to get a rough idea about the work just by skimming through the figures and tables.
% Thus, outlining the paper like a presentation around key figures and diagrams could work.


%% Content/writing checklist: (Kniivilä et al. 2017, p. XXX)

% 1. Is the title appropriate? Does it describe and properly frame the work?
% 2. Does the abstract describe the final work? Does it meet any external requirements?
% (3. Is the table of contents logical and balanced?)
% 4. Does the introduction describe the aims of this work, and its place in the larger scientific context?
% 5. Do the discussion and conclusions tie into the introduction? Do we address the aims and the scientific context?
% 6. Is the scientific/theoretical background specific enough to properly back up the research questions?
% 7. Are all the presented methods properly justified?
% 8. Can the presented methods justifiably answer/address the research questions?
% 9. Are the methods described in enough detail to allow reproducibility?
% 10. Do the presented results and discussion address the research question?


%% Formatting/finalization checklist: (Kniivilä et al. 2017, p. XXX)

% 11. Does each section/subsection only contain what's relevant based on its title?
% 12. Do paragraphs have clear "idea sentences", and enough supporting sentences and meta-textual connectors?
% 13. Are all tables/figures/equations a necessary and natural part of the text? Are they properly addressed in the body text?
% 14. Are citations formatted according to the requirements?
% 15. Does the references list contain all items that are cited?
% 16. Do all references contain enough information to identify and find the sources?
% 17. Are punctuations, citations, references, etc. formatted properly?
% 18. Does the text contain unnecessary phrases or repetition that could be removed?
% 19. Do we meet all formatting requirements? Are we using a correct template?
% 20. Have I asked for feedback on the content, language, and readability? Have I received it and have I given it the proper thought?
